        <p>
          Established in 2021, the Shakoor lab at the Donald Danforth Plant
          Science Center is working hard to create a high-impact research
          program that integrates and applies data streams from diverse
          technologies and disciplines towards addressing specific, real-world
          challenges in sustainable cropping systems. The lab develops and uses
          integrated digital agriculture systems to study the effects of
          phenotype, genotype, and environment on crop productivity. In a
          collaboration with the Salk Institute of Biological Studies, leading
          edge tools, methods, and technologies are being utilized to study and
          optimize the ability of Sorghum bicolor to capture carbon dioxide from
          the atmosphere and store it in its roots, shoots and leaves. Key
          overarching research questions that drive the activities of the lab
          include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            How can we better leverage genomics data in molecular breeding
            programs with high-throughput phenomics and environmental data to
            rapidly generate datasets for candidate gene identification?
          </li>
          <li>
            How can we use advances in sensors and sensing technologies to
            bridge the controlled environment to field knowledge gap?
          </li>
          <li>
            How can we leverage advances in digital agriculture and geospatial
            systems to fully capture the effects of genotype, environment and
            management (GxExM) to breed better crops and build models of
            sustainability for farmers?
